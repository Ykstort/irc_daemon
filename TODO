next?
 ° start putting client writes through the parsing engine,
 ° implement login handshake (USER/NICK whatever)

NEW FIRST THING TO DO:
 ° write an async io program that binds to a port and accepts connections

so far:
 ° the parsing engine is fairly complete
 ° bits and pieces of runtime data structuring have been mapped out, i.e.
    ° client, user and server structs - hash tables with ids for each
    ° what else?
 ° irc/rfc_defs.rs has a list of checks for nicks, chan names etc. conforming to spec

to be done next:
 ° async IO model for sockets (tokio) -done
 ° implement appropriate callbacks for:
    ° client connections -done
    ° client writes -done
    ° dropped connections -done
 ° be thread aware for all the above, -yes
 ° then implement a thread pool for work handling -tokio seems to be doing this

to REALLY be done next:
 ° write a small async test program using tokio, with the following spec:
    ° binds to a port - check
    ° accepts incoming connections - check
    ° monitors for incoming writes - check
    ° relays all complete lines (CRLF terminated) to all other clients -check
    ° no IRC message parsing (to begin with)
